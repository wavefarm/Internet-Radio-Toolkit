VS1053
    System starts in 1.0x clock mode
    SPI clock full wave is 4 CLKI cycles
    CLKI = onboard crystal * CLOCKF multiplier

    It takes 5 ns from CS down before we can raise the SCK
    (5ns is 200MHz half wave)
    It take 1 CLKI cycle at the end before we can raise CS

    Adafruit change the clock to 3.0x
    sciWrite(VS1053_REG_CLOCKF, 0x6000);
    Maximum SCK 9.216 MHz

VS1063
    System starts in 1.0x clock mode
    SPI clock full wave is 4 CLKI cycles
    CLKI = onboard crystal * CLOCKF multiplier

    Timing is the same as for the VS1053

    Maximum SCK frequency at startup 3.072 MHz
    Maximum SCK at 5.5x 16.896 MHz

    When changing the clock speed, wait a bit for it to settle.

    12 MHz seems to be the fastest SCK we can run
    192kbps reads 4096 bytes in 25 ms

    10 MHz reads in 26 ms
    8 MHz reads in 28 ms
