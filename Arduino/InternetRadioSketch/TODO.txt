(1)
Add Kiosk mode

(a) kiosk_mode = 0 | 1 .. set via the hardware switch
if the hardware switch is ON (1) and there is a 'kiosk.html' file,
then serve kiosk.html .. otherwise operate with the normal
index.html file. The kiosk will stream whichever listen/transmit
stream is running through the system.

(b) if the transmit icy url == "" then we don't connect to an icy server
but we still stream through mp3 to the wifi server

(c) when the wifi server starts up it notes the startup ..
    _server_start_time = millis();
    _server_two_minute_timeout = false;
    _server_use_kiosk_page = false;

(d) when wifi server runs ..
    if (!_server_two_minute_timeout) {
        now = millis();
        if ((now - _server_start_time) > (120*1000)) {
            _server_two_minute_timeout = true;
            if (SettingItem::findUInt("kiosk_mode_is_on", 0)) {
                _server_use_kiosk_page = true;
            }
        }
    }

(e) kiosk.html
Use the play button + audio tag like in the config page, but make the
audio tag become visible only after the play button has been pressed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(DONE)
Physical controls:
Peter your "listening mode selection" switch aka browser or icecast will be
coming in hot on pin 15 and the volume control pot will be on pin 35

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(DONE)
Newer way to do load-on-play with the audio element

<audio controls="controls" preload="none">
</audio>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(DONE)
JS stuff for handling mobile

document.addEventListener("visibilitychange", () => {
  if (document.visibilityState === "hidden") {
    // We are now in the background
    // close the WS connection
  } else {
    // We have just come into the foreground
    // reconnect to the WS
  }
});

CHANGE the focus handler so that it checks for a connection and only
reconnects if we are disconnected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(DONE)
Make the post file code compatible with binary uploads
i.e. we can't use the \0 terminator as a way to find the end
of the input buffer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(DONE)
Change large static http buffer to a inbetween stream buffer

-> we want to use a short static buffer for GET requests and WS messages
-> BUT we need to be able to stream in POST requests
 The POST requests will have to block the server thread until the POST
 is finished.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(DONE)
UPLOAD page works.
We also need to support changing the Router SSID and Password via the default
page.
And the page should also post the local IP4 address if it knows it.
And also the AP IP4 address so you can use it on your phone

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(DONE) .. maybe we can fix the bug when reconnecting to the AP on a phone

If the AP login page is still sitting in the browser then it assumes
that everything is already loaded and doesn't do a new load event.

window.addEventListener("focus", function(event)
{
    // check to make sure the WS is running and has updated settings
}, false);

We could add this into the static initializer of the toolkitSocket class.
It should look like this ..

    window.addEventListener("focus", function(event)
    {
        if (toolkitSocket.isConnected()) {
            toolkitSocket.close();
        }
        setTimeout(function() {
            toolkitSocket.open();
        }, 500);
    }, false);

    try this and see if it works .. so that we refresh the settings
    whenever we regain focus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(DONE)
Some of the captive portal page commands need to be "live"

- listening volume .. can be changed in realtime

- can the agc/manual volume be changed during a recording?
SCI_AICTRL1 - 16 bits encoder gain 1024 = 1.0 or 0 for AGC
SCI_AICTRL2 - 16 bits max AGC 1024 = 1.0, 64x-1 is the maximum

- changing between Transmitter and Kiosk mode could be done in realtime
  (see below)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(DONE)

Echo WS settings messages to all WS connections to keep all clients in sync

THIS means redoing a bunch of code, since some of it is static and some
is part of the non-static buy single ToolkitWiFi code

boolean websocket_handleIncoming(const char *buffer, size_t size)
    // then we an also handle the messages that cause "live" updates
    // volume, ..

needs to become part of ToolkitWiFi .. then we can add
a send to other WS connections function (name, value)
using websocket_sendString(twfc, const char *)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(DONE)

Do we miss server requests because the packets are either split or merged?
This might be why the captive portal breaks once in a while.

ALSO we close the http socket right away and don't allow the browser to
reuse it .. might make sense to have a timeout for that so that the
socket stays open unless it hasn't been used for a few milliseconds.

(a) update the http request receiver code to check for multiple requests

(b) keep the connection open for 1 second beyond the last request.
It should probably be set back to type UNKNOWN once a request has been
handled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(MAYBE NOT NEEDED) now that the streaming code is fixed
sometimes it is better to let the driver do what it likes to do.

client.setNoDelay(true);  // set this on the icy and mp3 clients

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(DONE)

set encoder and listener task priorities to 2
(so that they don't get stalled by the WiFi streaming)

move WiFi server task and icecast reconnect tasks to CPU 0

increase WiFi server head size .. seems to clear up the stalling on
the WiFi writes .. maybe there is some weird swap stuff going on with
the big buffers once they have been passed to the esp32 WiFi code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(DONE) .. prints out an error message if we timeout

size_t client.write(data, size) // check the actual bytes sent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(DONE)

Changed buffer stream to hold 3 seconds at 128kbps.

It is a rotating buffer that will write over itself if the outgoing
stream doesn't run fast enough.

Outgoing stream runs 2 or more buffers behind the incoming stream.
