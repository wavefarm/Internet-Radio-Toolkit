Wave Farm's Transmission and Sound Art Toolkit

For organizations and Wave Farm Transmit Partners, the Transmission and Sound Art Toolkit is a self-contained kit that enables live audio streaming via WiFi using either the Toolkit’s built-in microphone or line-in audio. The Toolkit communicates with Wave Farm’s Icecast server to provide online audio streaming and automatically records and publishes audio archives. For artists, the Toolkit is an Arduino-based open source expandable platform for telematic performance and remote sonic and physical interaction.

This repo contains the hardware design files in EAGLE CAD format, manufacturing files, Arduino code and enclosure files in OpenSCAD and STL formats.

The project is based on the ESP32W-ROVER platform and the VLSI VS1063 IC.
